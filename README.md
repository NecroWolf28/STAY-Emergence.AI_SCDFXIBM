# STAY-Emergence.AI_SCDFXIBM
Just a group of students stuck at home during COVID-19 :/

Our team consists of Sean, Timothy, Alex and Yew Meng, and our initials form the word STAY, hence our group name. In this current climate, we thought it was apt since all of us are required to STAY home.

a) 
The problem we are tackling is focused on the elderly, especially those who live alone or in a seculded area. If these elderly were to collapse at home or suffer from a cardiac arrest or heart attack, they may be incapacitated and be unable to move to their home phone or mobile phone to make an emergency call. This gave us the idea to utilise wearables with sensors to detect their heart rate as well as accelerometers to detect a fall. There are many of these wearables widely available, from brands such as FitBit. We decided to write a program that will send relevant important data to SCDF (wearer's name, location, incident, etc.) and ensure that the elderly will be provisioned help as soon as possible, and by doing so, greatly decrease

b) pitch video link here*

c) architecture*

d) hyperlink to your detailed solution* (Long description of your solution, the kill switch can be explained here, as well as the ML for the images)

e) project roadmap/proposed timeline

f) Getting started* (Step-by-step instructions to install the required software and how
to run a demo of your solution)

g) Running the tests (Explanation and breakdown on how to run tests for the proposed
solution)

h) Live demo (Link to an actual working demo/website) we can only show the flow since we don't have the actual hardware

i) What your team used to build your solution* (e.g. IBM Cloudant, IBM Cloud
Functions, etc...)

* means compulsory

# STAY-Emergence.AI_SCDFXIBM
Just a group of students stuck at home during COVID-19 :/

Our team consists of Sean, Timothy, Alex and Yew Meng, and our initials form the word STAY, hence our group name. In this current climate, we thought it was apt since all of us are required to STAY home.

# The Problem and Our Solution
The problem we are tackling is focused on the elderly, especially those who live alone or in a secluded area. If these elderly were to collapse at home or suffer from a cardiac arrest or heart attack, they may be incapacitated and be unable to move to their home phone or mobile phone to make an emergency call. This gave us the idea to utilise wearables with sensors to detect their heart rate as well as accelerometers to detect a fall. There are many of these wearables widely available, from brands such as FitBit. We decided to write a program that will send relevant important data to SCDF (wearer's name, location, incident, etc.) and ensure that the elderly will be provisioned help as soon as possible, and by doing so, greatly increase the chance of survival in these incidents.

# [Our Detailed Solution](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1iO-BQS5iraRGK70F51y7vvYXo1Ny9nYJ-yu_r1TuJtg/edit?usp=sharing)

# Getting Started
The .exe file that would be the software for the wearable can be found in the repo, along with its commented source code.

The Node-RED flow can be found [here](https://ems-teamstay.mybluemix.net/red/#flow/cdae95e1.ea0468), or can be imported into your own Node-RED environment with the JSON file included in the repo (keep in mind that you'll need to change the EMS URL attribute in the App class).

To run the wearable software, simply open the .exe file, or run the app.py file in the source folder.

Once the app is loaded, there are several debugging commands:
* r - Resets


g) Running the tests (Explanation and breakdown on how to run tests for the proposed
solution)

h) Live demo (Link to an actual working demo/website) we can only show the flow since we don't have the actual hardware

i) What your team used to build your solution* (e.g. IBM Cloudant, IBM Cloud
Functions, etc...)

"*" means compulsory
